- TODO this page needs refactoring
- naive bitcoin transactions lack privacy
	- common input ownership heuristic and change identification
		- vaguely described by Satoshi
		- explicated by Ron & Shamir, studied observationally
			- metadata correlated from public websites
		- fistful of bitcoins paper, first empirical study
			- sent btc down a mixer, analyzed results
		- Jonas Nick's thesis
			- BIP 37 privacy leak
				- exponential decay of noise, thought to be anonymizing, through long term collection
			- empirical confirmation of clustering heuristics
	- proliferation of quasi identifiers
- privacy losses occur, with few exceptions, at a rate that is expoenential in the amount of leaked data
	- the privacy literature is riddled with examples of deanonymizations
	- a common failure mode is analyzing components in isolation
	- another common failure mode is assuming worst case behavior from the adversary's perspective, instead of the user's
	- in bitcoin many hazards:
		- unencrypted p2p network, known to have byzantine and honest-but-curious nodes
			- bip 324
		- transactions leak a lot of metadata
			- many known structural fingerprints
			- amounts are inherently leaky
				- correlatable to real world fiat prices
			- transaction graph especially troublesome
				- combinatorial explosion of potential quasi-identifiers to consider for every coin
	- examples
		- non-bitcoin
			- us census [[k-anonymity]]
			- netflix graph, Naranyan & Shmatikov
			- browser fingerprinting
			- monerolink
			- zcash shielded pool p2p leak
		- bitcoin

- strong fungibility is emergent from privacy
	- can also be a legal or social construct
	- but if non-fungibility cannot be enforced then fungibility is self evident
- privacy and fungibility are a requirement for censorship resistance
	- non-fungibility in and of itself is a kind of censorship
		- discriminatory costs may exclude some participants
	- lack of privacy exposes users to harms
		- safety
		- fraud
		- surveillance
		- loss of business confidentiality
	- chilling effects create an unobservable baseline level of self censorships
- difficulties with consensus level privacy enhancements:
	- *asymptotically* worse scaling behavior
	- for confidential transaction like homomorphic values non post quantum homomorphic commitment scheme is not future proof:
		- quantum adversary can either break privacy or inflate, depending on whether commitment scheme is computationally hiding or binding
	- additionallly, monero & zcash both had cryptographic soundness related inflation bugs
	- bitcoin consensus is hard enough to change with soft forks, adoption is slow
