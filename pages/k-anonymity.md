- [Protecting Privacy when Disclosing Information: k-Anonymity and Its Enforcement through Generalization and Suppression](https://dataprivacylab.org/dataprivacy/projects/kanonymity/paper3.pdf) by Pierangela Samarati and Latanya Sweeney
- describes a procedure for suppressing/generalizing [[quasi-identifier]]s in a tabular data release so that even when they are combined there are never fewer than $k$ rows for any particular combination
- also describes the alarming previous results of deanonymizing a significant fraction of the US census database using such combinations matched against voter registries
- in Bitcoin
	- we can think of a series of "releases" that append to the previous ones
	- unique cryptographic identifiers, used correctly, are not reused and are indistinguishable from random
	- p2p metadata, such as IP addresses
	- temporal fingerprints
	- known transaction fingerprints are quasi identifiers
	- the transaction graph creates a combinatorial explosion of additional ones through successor/predecessor relation ("taint")
		- simplest case, common input ownership heuristic: a wallet cluster is a quasi identifier
			- this is not a technicality arising from there being multiple coins, so therefore it is not unique, but rather because of well known counterexamples, such as the MtGoxAndOthers on walletexplorer[dot]com
	- we also care about blockchain external (meta)data, such as personally identifying information given for compliance reasons
	- simplest example of k-anonymous outputs:
		- outputs of a coinjoin with identical amounts and script types
			- which are subsequently all spent separately in their entirety in 1 input transactions, see [[toxic change problem]]

- [[entropic anonymity]] refines this to account for situations
