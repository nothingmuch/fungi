- these are overlay networks designed to provide anonymity or privacy on the transport layer
	- use correctly this can suppress [[quasi-identifier]] leaks arising from network metadata
- tor
	- connection oriented, low latency onion routing over "circuits"
	- to avoid linking messages circuit isolation must be used
		- circuit management is a challenge both for robustness and for privacy
			- circuit establishment involves highly variable delays and non negligible failure probability
			- this can result strong temporal fingerprints, especially because the tor daemon builds new circuits sequentially
	- not designed to resist global passive adversary performing timing correlations
		- confidentiality and size uniformity can still afford users with an [[anonymity set]] against such an adversary within a single transaction
			- this is not post quantum safe so such sessions might still be deanonymized after the fact
- i2p
	- datagram support
- LN onion messaging?
- katzenpost?
- gnunet?
- veilid?
	- new, seems promising
- nym?
	- very rigorous privacy model, based on loopix & sphinx
		- TODO references
	- complicated architecture
	- has a coin
