- anonymous credentials are used to authenticate protocol messages without breaking privacy
- various systems can instantiate
	- token type
		- unit valued tokens (e.g. blind signature based)
			- e.g. privacy pass tokens, blind dh e-cash
		- structured attributes
			- e.g. wabisabi, coconut
	- unlinkable multi show
	- keyed verification vs. public verification vs. threshold issuance
- the [[protocol]] requires credentials with [[homomorphic value commitments]] for authenticating output funding and weight unit quotas
- credential systems for unit valued token
	- privacy pass credentials
	- RSA blind signatures
- they are issued in response to issuance requests with a valid attribute is valid according to the protocol rules
- numerical quantities  are represented
