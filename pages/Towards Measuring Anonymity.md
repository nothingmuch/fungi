- main contributions
	- system model
		- very general: any system where different [[user]]s exchange [[message]]s over a network (graph)
	- qualitative adversary capability model
		- $\{ \mathrm{local}, \mathrm{global} \} \times \{ \mathrm{passive}, \mathrm{active} \} \times \{ \mathrm{external}, \mathrm{internal} \}$
		- global means able to corrupt any node in the system
		- active means the adversary and can alter or disrupt messages
			- c.f. byzantine vs. semi-honest/honest-but-curious
			- c.f. covert adversary
		- global active internal adversary is essentially omnipotent rules out existence of a [[trusted computing base]] even in a weakened form
		- examples:
			- dragnet surveillance is global passive external
			- many fake nodes on p2p network
				- global, passive, external
				- dust attacks & rebroadcasting
			- a (potentially malicious) counterparty is generally local, active, external
			- malware is internal
	- [[entropic anonymity]] to quantitatify degree of anonymity provided by different systems against different kinds of of adversaries
