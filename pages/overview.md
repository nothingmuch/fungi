- for a bitcoin wallet to protect a [[user]]'s privacy
	- it must:
		- account for privacy, or rather its absence
			- within individual transactions
			- accounting for the transaction graph context
			- accounting for metadata leaks and [[quasi-identifier]]s
				- blockchain data acquisition
				- network fingerprints
				- temporal fingerprints
			- see [[problem statement]]
		- facilitate multiparty transactions
			- other ((semi-)honest, privacy seeking) users are a necessary condition for privacy
	- this can be achieved by:
		- [[privacy analysis]], to account for privacy losses
		- a resillient [[protocol]] for privacy preserving transaction construction
		- a [[cost function]] for making determinations about wallet state transition
			- used to make decisions during protocol execution based on the analysis
			- simplest state transitions: transactions in an onchain wallet
			- however, there are also intermediate states to be considered such as starting various multiparty interactions, e.g. lightning or coinjoin
