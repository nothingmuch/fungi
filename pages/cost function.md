		- [[threat model]] interprets the output of the [[privacy analysis]] to allow us to estimate [[anonymity set]] sizes under these different assumptions but this needs to be made comparable to e.g. the objective fee cost
		- the user's willingness to pay fee overheads (in terms of intuitive budget controls) and the threat model give a lower bound to the perceived harm of attacks on the user's privacy
			- using the threat model we can derive an worst case probability of deanonymization assuming all users are legitimate
			- this relates to an expectation of harm, that is necessarily larger than what the user is willing to pay
			- therefore dividing the probability out of this expected value we can obtain an estimate of the harm of deanonymizing a coin/tx
			- not clear how to relate this term to benefit to the adversary but they are clearly proportional
		- sybil attack cost estimation can be given in terms of
			- fee cost to create the tx graph context
			- liquidity requirements integrated over time
		- if the cost to perform a sybil attack is significantly greater than the benefit to the adversary of deanonymizing successfully, then we can assume that the anonymity set is legitimate
			- in other words, without unforgeable costliness, privacy assurances are very weak
			- for users earning fees from such transactions, costliness must be imposed via time costs
			- this is incentive compatible with improved privacy, but only if profitability is limited, otherwise it can subsidize sybil attacks
		- wallet states that are not sufficiently private according to the threat model impose a liability on their constituent coins, that can be discharged by spending into privacy enhanced transactions
- additional terms
	- (scheduled) payment intents can be represented as a time dependent, which exceeds the payment amount past the deadline
	- usual coin selection considerations apply
