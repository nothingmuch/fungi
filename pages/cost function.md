- privacy terms
	- threat models
		- blockchain observer
			- local public adversary
		- counterparty
			- local active adversary
		- metadata observer
			- global passive/covert adversary
		- metadata observer + counterparty
			- eve-alice-eve / streaming wallet model
			- anonymity set is quantified by counting counterfactual paths through transaction graph
	- cost normalization
		- threat model output includes transaction subgraph
			- sybil attack cost estimation can be given in terms of
				- fee cost
				- liquidity requirements integrated over time
		- the user's willingness to pay fee overheads (in terms of intuitive budget controls) and the threat model give a lower bound to the perceived harm of attacks on the user's privacy
		- wallet states that are not sufficiently private according to the threat model impose a liability on their constituent coins, that can be discharged by spending into privacy enhanced transactions
- additional terms
	- (scheduled) payment intents can be represented as a time dependent, which exceeds the payment amount past the deadline
