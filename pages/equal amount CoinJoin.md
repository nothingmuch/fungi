- a class of transaction structures described by Greg Maxwell's original post, basis for the concrete structures of:
    - JoinMarket
    - Wasabi 1.x
    - Samourai
- these are multiparty transactions which attempt to subvert the [[common input ownership heuristic]]
- if multiple users contribute inputs to a transaction, and create outputs which are identical up to the controlling key, avoiding reuse, these outputs will benefit from [[k-anonymity]] since each one could belong to any of the users
- although Bitcoin transactions are limited in size (block size consensus limit, and standadness limit), in theory this does not limit the size of the [[anonymity set]] that can be obtained
	- a single transaction with 4 inputs and 4 outputs is equivalent to 4 transactions with 2 inputs and outputs each, so long as as these follow the structure of an interconnection network
- practical challenges
	- fees must be paid which implies the input amount and output amount must differ
		- this limits the interconnection network transactions graph topology
		- or it necessarily requires multiple inputs per user
	- multiple inputs are also needed due to the fixed denomination, [[toxic change problem]]
