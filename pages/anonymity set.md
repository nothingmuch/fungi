- from the [[adversary]]'s perspective, given a [[message]] (c.f. Diaz et al) sent in a system, this is the set of users that might have sent (or received) it
- in bitcoin we can consider at least two kinds of anonymity sets:
	- coins and their predecessor coins
	- owners of coins ~~ wallet clusters
- we want to consider two kinds of metrics for anonymity sets
	- [[k-anonymity]] is a model that applies when the [[adversary]]'s probability of guessing correctly from the set is no better than uniform.
	- [[entropic anonymity]] is a more general model when the probability distribution is non-uniform
